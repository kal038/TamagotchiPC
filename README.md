**Project Tamagotchi**  
The Tamagotchi (たまごっち, IPA: [tamaɡotꜜtɕi]) is a handheld digital pet, created in Japan by
 Akihiro Yokoi [ja] of WiZ and Aki Maita of Bandai. It was released by Bandai on November 23, 
 1996 in Japan and May 1, 1997 in the rest of the world, quickly becoming one of the biggest toy fads of the late 1990s 
 and the early 2000s. As of 2010, over 76 million Tamagotchis had been sold worldwide.[1] As of 2017, over 82 million units 
 have been sold.[2] Most Tamagotchi are housed in a small egg-shaped computer with an interface consisting of three buttons.
 The goal of the game is to take care of a virtual, fictional, mythical pet so that it evolves.  
In this project, Team Bixby attemps to port the famous handheld game to the PC environent using Java and JavaFX. 
The graphics and controls of the game are replicated so that the PC version provides the same experience as a handheld 
Tamagotchi console, which has become rarer to find these days.  
**Package Structure**  
The game is compiled from 4 main packages: GUI, Images, Pet, and Main. GUI contains the front end user interface of the game. Images contains all sprites created to represent the pet. The Pet class represents the logical model of the pet as well as the features of the game itself and the main class is where we run a game instance, pulling in components from the different packages that we have
